APIHelper
=========

A set of methods to help me not have to rewrite API interactions in the future.  First stab at it.  May be a better way.

How to:

* Reference the library in your project.
* Create a BroadcastReceiver, where necessary, to listen for results.
* Pass a url and parameters to an api method.
* See example project for details.
